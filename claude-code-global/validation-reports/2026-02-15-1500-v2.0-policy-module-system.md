## Validation Report: v2.0 Policy Module System
**Date**: 2026-02-15 15:00
**Commit**: (pending)
**Status**: PASSED

### Phase 3: Tests
- Test suite: bash -n (syntax check on all .sh scripts)
- Results: 4 scripts passing (install.sh, uninstall.sh, ralph-loop.sh, ralph-prompt.sh)
- Coverage: N/A (shell scripts, no unit test framework)
- Status: PASSED

### Phase 4: Code Quality
- Dead code: None found
- Duplication: None found - policies are distinct modules
- Encapsulation: Well-structured - core + policies separation
- Refactorings: N/A (new files, not refactoring existing code)
- Status: PASSED

### Phase 5: Security Review
- Dependencies: N/A (no package dependencies)
- OWASP Top 10: N/A (configuration files, not application code)
- Anti-patterns: Verified no hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials in any files
- Company/PII scrub: Grep confirmed zero matches for "attackiq", "aiq-", "AP-NNNNN", "company-managed", "company-wide", "aiq_agent"
- Status: PASSED

### Phase 5.5: Release Safety
- Change type: Code + configuration (new policy module system)
- Rollback plan: Revert commit; previous v1.3.1 install.sh still works with monolithic CLAUDE.md
- Backward compatible: Projects without `## Selected Policies` continue to work (core methodology applies)
- Status: PASSED

### Overall
- All gates passed: YES
- Notes: Synced claude-code-global with aiq-ralph v2.0 architecture. 11 policy modules created across 4 categories (languages, git, release-safety, integrations). All company-specific references scrubbed. Version bumped to 2.0.0 across all files.
