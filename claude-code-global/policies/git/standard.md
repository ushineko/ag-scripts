# Git Operations: Standard

> Standard git conventions suitable for most projects.

## Commit Conventions

- **No Co-Authored-By**: Do NOT include `Co-Authored-By` lines in commit messages
- **No AI attribution footers**: Do NOT include "Generated with Claude Code", "Generated by AI", or similar attribution lines in commit messages, PR/MR descriptions, comments, or any other generated content. The work product stands on its own — provenance is tracked through process, not watermarks
- Commit messages should be concise and descriptive
- Use conventional commit prefixes (feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor, test)
- Use imperative mood in commit summaries ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep commits focused and atomic - one logical change per commit

## Remote Connectivity Check

**Before running `git push`, `git pull`, or `git fetch`:**
- Test connectivity first with a short timeout: `timeout 5 git ls-remote --exit-code origin HEAD`
- If it fails or hangs, inform the user that the VPN may need to be manually bounced
- Only proceed with the actual git operation after connectivity is confirmed

## Force-Push Safety

- **NEVER** force-push to `master`, `main`, or `release/*` branches
- **Feature branches**: Force-push is acceptable during pre-review cleanup, but communicate with collaborators first
- **After force-push**: Collaborators must `git fetch && git reset --hard origin/<branch>` to sync
