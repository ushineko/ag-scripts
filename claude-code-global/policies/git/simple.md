## Commit Conventions

- **No Co-Authored-By**: Do NOT include `Co-Authored-By` lines in commit messages
- **No AI attribution footers**: Do NOT include "Generated with Claude Code", "Generated by AI", or similar attribution lines in commit messages, PR/MR descriptions, comments, or any other generated content
- Use conventional commit prefixes (feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor, test)
- Use imperative mood in commit summaries ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep commits focused and atomic - one logical change per commit
