description: Update the project documentation (README.md) listing all scripts.
---

1.  Identify all script files (Python, Shell, etc.) in the repository, including subdirectories.
2.  Extract a brief description for each script (from docstrings, comments, or --help output).
3.  Update (or create) the root `README.md` file.
    *   It should contain a "Scripts" section.
    *   The section should be a table or detailed list with columns: Script Name/Path, Description.
    *   Preserve any existing manual documentation in README.md if possible, or append to it.
