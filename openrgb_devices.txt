<h2>Some internal devices may not be detected:</h2><p>One or more I2C or SMBus interfaces failed to initialize.</p><p><b>RGB DRAM modules, some motherboards' onboard RGB lighting, and RGB Graphics Cards, will not be available in OpenRGB</b> without I2C or SMBus.</p><h4>How to fix this:</h4><p>On Linux, this is usually because the i2c-dev module is not loaded.</p><p>You must load the i2c-dev module along with the correct i2c driver for your motherboard. This is usually i2c-piix4 for AMD systems and i2c-i801 for Intel systems.</p><p>See <a href='https://help.openrgb.org/'>help.openrgb.org</a> for additional troubleshooting steps if you keep seeing this message.<br></p><h3>If you are not using internal RGB on a desktop this message is not important to you.</h3>
