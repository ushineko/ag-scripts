## Validation Report: DHCP Lease Monitor Core Widget (v1.1.0)
**Date**: 2026-02-18
**Status**: PASSED

### Scope
- Spec: `dhcp-lease-monitor/specs/001-core-widget.md`
- Release commit: `d753131`

### Phase 3: Tests
- Syntax check: `/usr/bin/python3 -m py_compile dhcp-lease-monitor/dhcp-lease-monitor.py dhcp-lease-monitor/lease_reader.py dhcp-lease-monitor/device_identifier.py`
- Test suite: `cd dhcp-lease-monitor && /usr/bin/python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_device_identifier.py tests/test_lease_reader.py`
- Results: `13 passed`, `0 failed`
- Status: PASSED

### Phase 4: Code Quality
- Core features verified in release pass:
  - static leases pinned to top with special styling
  - expired leases shown dimmed
  - runtime interface detection from routing table
  - consistent right-click menu behavior/positioning
  - reverse-DNS shown per lease with bounded cache
- Status: PASSED

### Phase 5: Security Review
- Data flow remains read-only for DHCP state (lease file parsing and route-table inspection).
- Reverse-DNS resolution uses resolver calls only (`getent hosts`, `socket.gethostbyaddr`) with short timeout and no elevated privileges.
- Regex-based secrets scan was run on `dhcp-lease-monitor/` with no matches.
- Status: PASSED

### Phase 5.5: Release Safety
- Change type: release-level change (new project subtree + v1.1.0 release update).
- Rollback plan:
  1. Revert release commit `d753131`
  2. Revert this validation-report commit
- Status: PASSED

### Overall
- All gates passed: YES
