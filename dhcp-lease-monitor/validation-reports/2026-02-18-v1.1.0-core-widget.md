## Validation Report: DHCP Lease Monitor Core Widget (v1.1.0)
**Date**: 2026-02-18
**Status**: PASSED

### Scope
- Spec: `dhcp-lease-monitor/specs/001-core-widget.md`
- Release commit: `d753131`

### Phase 3: Tests
- Syntax check: `/usr/bin/python3 -m py_compile dhcp-lease-monitor/dhcp-lease-monitor.py dhcp-lease-monitor/lease_reader.py dhcp-lease-monitor/device_identifier.py`
- Test suite: `cd dhcp-lease-monitor && /usr/bin/python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_device_identifier.py tests/test_lease_reader.py`
- Results: `13 passed`, `0 failed`
- Status: PASSED

### Phase 4: Code Quality
- Separation of concerns is preserved: parsing/routing in `lease_reader.py`, device heuristics in `device_identifier.py`, UI logic in `dhcp-lease-monitor.py`.
- Reverse-DNS logic is encapsulated into focused methods (`_with_reverse_dns`, `_resolve_reverse_dns`, `_lookup_reverse_dns`) instead of being inlined in `refresh_leases()`.
- Lookup behavior is bounded with explicit timeout and positive/negative TTL cache, reducing UI freeze risk and repeated resolver churn.
- Row rendering handles long PTR names with eliding + tooltip, and uses `QSizePolicy.Ignored` on the PTR label to prevent horizontal overflow.
- Residual gap: no dedicated unit tests for reverse-DNS cache/lookup branches yet (current automated coverage is parser/device-heuristic focused).
- Status: PASSED

### Phase 5: Security Review
- Data flow remains read-only for DHCP state (lease file parsing and route-table inspection).
- Reverse-DNS resolution uses resolver calls only (`getent hosts`, `socket.gethostbyaddr`) with short timeout and no elevated privileges.
- Regex-based secrets scan was run on `dhcp-lease-monitor/` with no matches.
- Status: PASSED

### Phase 5.5: Release Safety
- Change type: release-level change (new project subtree + v1.1.0 release update).
- Rollback plan:
  1. Revert release commit `d753131`
  2. Revert this validation-report commit
- Status: PASSED

### Overall
- All gates passed: YES
